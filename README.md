# Machine-learning
Heart Failure Prediction uses ML to assess heart failure risk from patient data. Models include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and Decision Tree. The best model (0.90 accuracy) is deployed via Flask API for real-time predictions, aiding early detection and better healthcare decisions.
